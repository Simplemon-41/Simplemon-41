**Secure Healthcare Records on Canton Network**

---

## ✨ Problem
Hospitals face difficulties in sharing patient records → slow registration, duplicate data, and data breach risks.

---

## 💡 Solution
**HealthChain** stores medical records on the **Canton Network**:  
- **Secure & encrypted** → patient data is protected.  
- **Permissioned access** → only authorized hospitals can view.  
- **Faster registration** → patient data can be reused across hospitals.

## 🔑 Key Features
- Blockchain-based patient ID  
- Encrypted off-chain medical records  
- Permissioned access (grant/revoke)  
- Full audit trail of access  

---

## 🧩 Architecture

Hospital App → API Gateway → Canton Ledger → Encrypted Storage

---

## 📅 Roadmap
- **MVP**: Smart contract + demo mockup  
- **Next**: API Gateway + Canton testnet integration  
- **Future**: Pilot with real hospitals
